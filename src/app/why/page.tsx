              For well over three years , MR has earned a well-deserved
              reputation for providing the highest quality supplies and parts in
              the imaging industry. More than any other factor, our dedication
              to quality separates MR from other companies seeking to become
              your alternative parts-and-supplies partner. We provide you with
              unsurpassed levels of quality and consistency and back our

              <br />
              Although MR strives to introduce products quickly so you can begin
              reducing your service costs on the model applications you service,
              we will not compromise on quality for the sake of being
              first-to-market. It’s our “best-to-market” philosophy. Unlike some
              other suppliers, who, in their rush to be first to market, release
              a product before it is fully developed and use paying customers as
              quality control, MR thoroughly tests every product before it is
              made available for sale. Many aftermarket suppliers don’t have the
              technical expertise, processes, and equipment that MR has. They
              simply find a manufacturing source and purchase their products
              “off the shelf,” sometimes without any proof of whether the
              product will work at all, let alone meet OEM-equivalent
              performance levels across real-world operating conditions. In
              their rush to be “first-to-market,” they can end up with products
              that don’t meet your expectations. If they do any in-machine
              testing, it may be very limited. Instead, you, the customer, may
              be doing their “testing” for them. Every MR brand product is
              tested to ensure it meets our performance expectations. We won’t
              sell a product until we get it “just right.” Sometimes that means
              other aftermarket products will be introduced before ours. While
              speed to market is important, we’ve learned over the past 40+
              years that our customers really want a quality product at
              significant cost savings. Therefore, we will continue to strive to
              provide you with “best-to-market” products and the best overall
              value.{" "}

              MR’s technical expertise and resources allow us to overcome design
              and development challenges that other suppliers can’t. In some
              cases, other aftermarket suppliers are offering color toner for
              the same machines; however, the performance and print quality
              differences are so significant that MR is the only supplier
              offering a truly OEM-equivalent product. In addition, MR has
              developed products that actually perform better than OEM products
              or compensate for OEM machine design flaws. These problem-solving
              products can lead to better machine performance or increased
              yields or parts life.

              This breadth and depth is especially important considering the
              still converging nature of the copier, printer, and MFP channels.
              Equally important, this comprehensive product portfolio enables
              dealers to easily meet the supplies requirements of equipment
              populations they’ve inherited due to awarded MPS contracts.
